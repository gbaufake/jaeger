# Hot R.O.D. - Rides on Demand - Containerized Version

This is a demo application that consists of several microservices and illustrates
the use of the OpenTracing API. It can be run standalone, but requires Jaeger backend
to view the traces. A tutorial / walkthough is available:
  * as a blog post [Take OpenTracing for a HotROD ride][hotrod-tutorial],
  * as a video [OpenShift Commons Briefing: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger & Prometheus on Kubernetes][hotrod-openshift].

## Features

* Discover architecture of the whole system via data-driven dependency diagram
* View request timeline & errors, understand how the app works
* Find sources of latency, lack of concurrency
* Highly contextualized logging
* Use baggage propagation to
  * Diagnose inter-request contention (queueing)
  * Attribute time spent in a service
* Use open source libraries with OpenTracing integration to get vendor-neutral instrumentation for free
